Title: Straigtfoward 'OpenDAP' Interaction Using Whatever 
Description: Interrogate, interact, and read data from 'OpenDAP' sources. Might be renamed to 'rdap', but
  this repository was originally created around the time that Sharon Jones passed away, so the name is a bit sentimental. 
  It's expected that this is easy enough to install in Linux, and automatically available via
   CRAN Windows binary 'ncdf4' in 64-bit R (but not in 32-bit windows R). Mac support is unknown to this author, so far.
